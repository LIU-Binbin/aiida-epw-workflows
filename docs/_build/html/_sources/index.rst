Welcome to aiida-supercon's documentation!
============================================

`aiida-supercon` is an AiiDA plugin designed to automate and manage high-throughput calculations for superconducting properties. It provides a series of robust, restartable workflows for calculating the electron-phonon coupling and critical temperature (Tc) using Quantum ESPRESSO and EPW.

This plugin is built upon the powerful infrastructure of `aiida-quantumespresso` and `aiida-wannier90-workflows`.
