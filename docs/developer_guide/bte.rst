This work chain is used to solve the Boltzmann transport equation.

There are several approximations to be used to solve or simplify the Boltzmann transport equation.

- iterative Boltzmann transport equation (iBTE)
- momentum Boltzmann transport equation (mBTE)
- Self-energy relaxation time approximation (SRETA)
- Allen model (Ziman equation)
